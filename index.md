The lidar2dems project is a collection open-source command line utilities for supporting the easy creation of
 Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from LiDAR data. lidar2dems uses the PDAL library (and associated dependencies
) for doing the actual point processing and gridding of point clouds into raster data.
