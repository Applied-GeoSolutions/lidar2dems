#lidar2dems

The lidar2dems project is a collection open-source (FreeBSD license) command line utilities for supporting the easy creation of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from LiDAR data. lidar2dems uses the PDAL library (and associated dependencies) for doing the actual point processing and gridding of point clouds into raster data.

See the [lidar2dems documentation](http://applied-geosolutions.github.io/lidar2dems/) for complete description, usage, and tutorial
