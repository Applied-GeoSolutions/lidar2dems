# LiDAR tools

This project is a collection of information and possibly source code for LiDAR utilities. The installation notes here are for Ubuntu 14.04.  Most of the open-source LiDAR tools available are not available as pre-built packages and must be compiled from source.  Start in a working build directory (e.g., ~/build). The instructions for each package assume you start in this working directory.
